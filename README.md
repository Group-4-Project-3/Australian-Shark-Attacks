# Australian Shark Attacks Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the Australian Shark Attacks Data Visualization project. The objective of this project was to visualize data related to shark attacks in Australia using various visualization techniques. The project was implemented using Jupyter Notebook and utilized libraries such as Folium and Dash for interactive visualizations.

## Project Details

- **Topic:** Australian Shark Attacks Data Visualization
- **Libraries Used:** Folium, Dash
- **Data Source:** Australian Shark-Incident Database (ASID)
https://taronga.org.au/conservation-and-science/australian-shark-incident-database
- **Team Collaboration:** The project was a collaborative effort involving four team members:
  - Brad
  - Drishti
  - Puja
  - Mel

## Features

The project includes the following features:

1. **Data Collection:** Data was collected from the Australian Shark-Incident Database (ASID) to gather information on shark attacks in Australia.

2. **Data Visualization:** The data was visualized using various techniques including:
   - Pie charts
   - Bar graphs
   - Interactive maps using Folium
   - Interactive dashboards using Dash

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files sourced from ASID.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter Notebook files containing the data visualization code.
- `results/`: Stores the visualizations generated by the code.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the tools and libraries used.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab).
4. Execute the code cells to generate the visualizations.

# Ethical Considerations

In crafting our shark attack dashboard, it was important to approach the victim data with concern and empathy in mind for shark victims and their families. Strict compliance with medical record privacy regulations was fundamental in our approach to this topic. Our first data source was the Florida Museum to target shark attacks globally. We were unable to use this sensitive information from around the world due to safeguarding the confidentiality and security of data related to victims' medical treatment and their recovery journey. Upholding the privacy and dignity of those affected by shark incidents was a core ethical consideration as we developed this dashboard. We were able to use the data from the Australian Shark Incident Database as the information was not as sensitive and lacking the data deatil of the global source.
